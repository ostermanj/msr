    <h4>The E.U. Market Stability Reserve Could Remove 3 Billion Tons of Emissions by 2030</h4>
    <div id="chart-0" class="multiple-chart-container chart-container"></div>
    <p class="highcharts-note multiple">Normal mitigation of 2.7% is from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. From left to right, the first three columns are flows that apply to the single year only; the last three columns are stocks, which accumulate from year to year. <strong>“Emissions”</strong> = the carbon emitted in that year (blue bar); the <strong>cap</strong> for that year—or, equivalently, the number of new allowances issued in that year—is represented by the horizontal line; the difference, or <strong>surplus</strong> allowances, is represented by the pink segment. <strong>“Net intake”</strong> = the net number of allowances removed from circulation and placed in reserve; this can be negative if the MSR falls below 400 million, triggering the release of 100 million allowances back into circulation. The first two years (2019 and 2020) include a predetermined amount of extra intake. <strong>“Cancel”</strong> = the number of carbon allowances removed from reserve and cancelled in that year. <strong>“TNAC”</strong> = total number of allowances in circulation, available for purchase. <strong>“MSR”</strong> = the total number of allowances placed in the Market Stability Reserve, not available for purchase. <strong>“Cancelled”</strong> = the total number of allowances cancelled.

    <h4>Reducing Emissions Early Leads to a Greater Cancellation of Allowances</h4>
    <div id="chart-1" class="multiple-chart-container chart-container"></div>
    <p class="highcharts-note multiple">The diagrams show the outcome due to an extra 1-ton emissions reduction that may result from companion policies in member states. The first diagram shows what happens, on average, to the allowances currently in circulation, based on the year in which they entered circulation. The second diagram shows the marginal effect, that is, what happens to the allowance that is freed up by the extra emissions reduction.</p>
