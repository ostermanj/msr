<h4>The E.U. Market Stability Reserve Could Remove 3 Billion Tons of Emissions by 2030</h4>
<p class="highcharts-title">Modeled outcomes of the Market Stability Reserve and cancellation of emissions allowances</p>
<div id="chart-0" class="multiple-chart-container chart-container"></div>
<p class="highcharts-note multiple">From left to right, the first three columns are flows that apply to the single year only; the last three columns are stocks, which accumulate from year to year. <strong>“Cancel”</strong> = the number of carbon allowances removed from reserve and cancelled in that year. <strong>“Intake”</strong> = the number of allowances removed from circulation and placed in reserve. <strong>“Emissions”</strong> = the carbon emitted in that year (blue bar); the <strong>cap</strong> for that year is represented by the horizontal line; the difference, or <strong>surplus</strong> allowances, is represented by the pink segment. <strong>“TNAC”</strong> = total number of allowances in circulation, available for purchase. <strong>“MSR”</strong> = the total number of allowances placed in the Market Stability Reserve, not available for purchase. <strong>“Cancelled”</strong> = the total number of allowances cancelled.
